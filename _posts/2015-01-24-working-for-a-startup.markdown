What's it like working for a startup?
===

I often try to convince my friends and old co-workers from large companies to check out the
startup scene in St. Louis. Here are a some of the common questions I get from them.

Overtime
---

Overtime is usually the most common concern I hear. Don't startups make you work 10 hour days
including weekends? Usually not, actually. To understand if you will be working a lot of
overtime or not you must first understand stock options.

When you get an offer to join a startup, usually they offer you some kind of package that
includes stock options. Stock options are an opportunity to purchase stock in the event
of a successful exit. For instance, if the startup gets bought or has an IPO, you will have
a change (after investors) to buy stock at a trivial amount. You can then immediately sell
the stock at market price, which can be pretty lucrative, or hang on to it in the event of
an IPO.

There are a lot of strategies for raising money that effects the potential value
of stock options. That will be a topic for a future post. What you need to know is stock
options have no value *unless* the company has a successful exit. So if you're planning on
quitting in a year or you think the company won't make it, there's no point in working for
high equity.

On the other hand, if the company is doing well, is in a great market, and you think you
can help them get to where they are going, then having a lot of stock options is what you
want. You and your coworkers will happily work overtime in this scenario because slacking
could make your options worthless.

This is a really interesting dynamic that you don't get working in a corporation. In a
way, you get to decide if you want to work overtime or not.

Web Development
---

Another concern I hear is or "I'm not a web or mobile developer."

Not all startups require you to be a web or mobile developer! There are a lot of game
startups in St. Louis, if that's your thing. There is also a big bio-informatics area where
native GUI applications could work.

However, I want to give some career advice. Can you think of a successful startup that
wasn't mostly a web or mobile application, game, or physical device? Me either.
If you aren't highly skilled in one of those areas it would probably be a good idea to invest
in yourself and learn to program for one of those areas.

Risk
---

Maybe you are married, have a kid or two, or just have a lot of school debt. Startups seem
like a risk you might not want to take on.

With startups, usually the founders are pretty open about how things are going. So if the
company is going to fail, you probably are going to know about it ahead of time. Plus if
you are getting hired into a startup, chances are they think they have enough "runway" to
keep you on for a while, either because of a large fund-raising round or because they have
some kind of revenue.

Larger companies fail too. They also layoff and sometimes do so without putting any thought
into it. Like removing entire departments. You often have no visibility into what's going on
in the C-level or even just the management layer above you. So you may be surprised one day
when you have specialized in Big Company's technology.

Do it

In conclusion, I hope you consider working for a startup. While it's not for everyone, it
might be right for you!
